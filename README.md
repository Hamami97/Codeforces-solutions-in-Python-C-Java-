# Codeforces-solutions-in-Python-C-Java-
This repository contains my solutions to problems from  Codeforces, a competitive programming platform. All solutions are written in [Python/C++/Java]  and organized by contest ID and problem category.

Solutions organized by Contest ID (e.g., Contest_123) and Problem ID (e.g., 123A - Problem Name). Easy to navigate and reference!
